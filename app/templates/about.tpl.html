   <p class = "about">Hi you guys! We are Liliya and Ashima and we are students at The Iron Yard in Atlanta, GA. We joined the September 2016 Front End cohort.</br>
   This app is the result of our first Hackathon. The assignment was to create an Instagram-like web app where you can make a photo album. The app allows you to like the photos and also add comments on them. There is an option to delete the image and also you can edit the description. </br>
   We built both the Frontend and Backend for our app. For our Backend we used AdonisJS which is a NodeJS framework and deployed our code on Heroku which is a cloud-based application plaform. For our Frontend we worked with AngularJS and used BULMA for styling. Our app is live on surge. </p>
