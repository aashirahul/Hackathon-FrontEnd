# Our first Hackathon

For this project I was paired with Ashima Shrivastava. We had to build both the frontend and the backend. We split the work up evenly amongst ourselves, but did most of the tasks using the agile pair-programming technique. This worked really well for us and we were able to get the work done quickly.

Ashima created the backend gitHub repo and she is the only one that added any commits to that repo. We did most of the work for the images together and then she continued to work on the backend for the likes and comments features while I started the frontend. While I worked on the controllers and the html templates, Ashima finished up with the backend and deployed to Heroku. We then added the likes and comments features to the frontend together and ended with some styling.
